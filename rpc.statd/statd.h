/*
 *  Data structures for recording monitored hosts
 *
 *  The information held by the status monitor comprises a list of hosts
 *  that we have been asked to monitor, and, associated with each monitored
 *  host, one or more clients to be called back if the monitored host crashes.
 *
 *  The list of monitored hosts must be retained over a crash, so that upon
 *  re-boot we can call the SM_NOTIFY procedure in all those hosts so as to
 *  cause them to start recovery processing.  On the other hand, the client
 *  call-backs are not required to be preserved: they are assumed (in the
 *  protocol design) to be local processes which will have crashed when
 *  we did, and so are discarded on restart.
 *
 *  We handle this by keeping the list of monitored hosts in a file
 *  (/var/db/statd.status) which is mmap()ed and whose format consists
 *  of the FileHeader followed by a packed list of HostInfo structures.
 *  For each currently-monitored host, a MonitoredHost structure associates
 *  the in-file HostInfo entry with a list of client notification callbacks.
 *  The MonitoredHost and Notify structures are held in normal memory and so
 *  will be lost on restart.
 *
 *  All values stored in network byte order.
